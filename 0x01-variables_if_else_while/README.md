1. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.[Source](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/02/c-program-to-check-whether-the-given-integer-is-positive-or-negative/)

2. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. with conditions.

The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line, sources that have been used [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559654/c-objective-c-read-and-get-last-digit-of-integer),[Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-statements-in-c/,),[Source](https://codeforwin.org/2015/06/how-to-find-first-and-last-digit-of-any-number.html).

2. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

3. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar three times in your code

4. Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code
here i did use `if` statement to avoid letter q and e.

5. Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

All your code should be in the main function
here we use chat and putchar to list the numbers in base 10 from 0 to 9.

Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

6. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar twice in your code
All your code should be in the main function
here instead of `char` we use `int`. and the syntax is the same.

7 .Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code.
Here i have to use decrement `--` to indicate that the operation have to go
in a decreasing way.[Source](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-operators).

8 .Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar three times in your code

9 .Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char,[Source](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-break-continue-statement).
